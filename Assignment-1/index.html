            <p>Molly had been staring out of her window for about an hour now. On her desk, lying between the copies of
                <em>Nature</em>,
                <em>New Scientist</em>, and all the other scientific journals her work had appeared in, was a
                well-thumbed copy of
                <cite>On The Road</cite>. It had been Molly's favorite book since college, and the longer she spent in
                these four walls
                the more she felt she needed to be free.

            <p>She had spent the last ten years in this room, sitting under a poster with an Oscar Wilde quote
                proclaiming that
                <q>Work is the refuge of people who have nothing better to do</q>. Although many considered her
                pioneering work,
                unraveling the secrets of the llama DNA, to be an outstanding achievement, Molly did think she had
                <em>something better to do</em>.
