                <li>1 tbs butter</li>

            <h2>Method</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>Melt butter in a frying pan over a medium heat</li>
                <li>Gently mix the eggs and cream in a bowl</li>
                <li>Once butter has melted, add cream and eggs</li>
                <li>Using a spatula, fold the eggs from the edge of the pan to the center every 20 seconds (as if you
                    are making an omelette)</li>
                <li>When the eggs are still moist, remove from the heat (it will continue to cook on the plate until
                    served)</li>
            </ol>
